<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to make a website that helps CossiePlay increases the number of costumes created per week and attracts more people going to its monthly parties. </p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> In order to achieve the goal, CossiePlay can use counting applications that keeps track of the views of the website. Hence the business would be able to identify how many people have their attention grabbed, and how many are potential to come to the parties. This would help the business controls the investment of the monthly parties and the level of production of the costumes. </p>
<p> CosiePlay can also count the number of shares done by users to the website. This would help the business identify the target market as who shared the websites are ones that concern about the business's services. Hence the business would be able to focus on its target market more easily.</p>
<p> Checking comments about the website would also be a good evaluation of how successful the website is. This method would help CossiePlay knows how users feel about the website, and what sections should be improved to meet the goal.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Since CossiePlays provides services such as parties and selling costumes, the target market of CossiePlay should be those who have dynamic and outrovert lifestyles.</p>
<p>However, not everyone in this segment has the same tastes of fashion, hence, segmenting the market to smaller targets would help CossiePlay designs its costumes:</p>
<li><p>Ages from 0 to 15: Costumes should be designed under Parent Guidance with some cute features. The designers of CossiePlay may use influences from cartoon characters to grab the attention for this target market. The sizes should be restricted as kid sizes so that they are wearable to the children.</p></li>
<li><p>Ages of 16 and above: Starting from 16, the majority of the market would be more mature, therefore, the costumes created for these people should have more complicated designs and suit their lifestyles. The quality of costumes for this age group is also more highly expected, in which CossiePlay would need to focus more on the production lines of the costumes. The sizes also get bigger, which may need more materials to produce the goods. </p></li>
